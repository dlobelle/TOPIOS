This repository contains my code under the TOPIOS (Tracking of Plastic in Our Seas) project at the University of Utrecht's Institute of Marine and Atmospheric Research, Utrecht. I am using NEMO-MEDUSA both to load the velocity field and the primary productivity to overlay on the location of plastic sinking in the Mediterranean as the first analysis of this project. The aim is to understand the impacts of biofouling on the sinking of plastic.
